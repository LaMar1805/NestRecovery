Arbitration </p> <p> By using this Website, End User agrees that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy End User may have against Nest Recovery arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, this Website, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”); (2) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for End User), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by End User and Nest Recovery; (3) the arbitrator shall apply Сalifornia law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (4) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the End User's and/or Nest Recovery's individual claims; and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (5) in the event that the End User is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Nest Recovery will pay as much of the End User's filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (6) with the exception of subpart (4) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, in which we may have to gather further identifiable information in order to confirm your identity, we will disclose to you the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p> The categories of Personal Information we collected about you; </p> </li> <li> <p> The categories of sources for Personal Information we collected about you; </p> </li> <li> <p> Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information; </p> </li> <li> <p> The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information; </p> </li> <li> <p> The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); and </p> </li> <li> <p> If we disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories disclosed. </p> </li> </ul> <p> We will deliver a verifiable access request and the accompanying information to you in a portable, easily readable electronic format. </p> <p> Right to Deletion </p> <p> The CCPA allows California residents the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we collect and retain, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, in which we may have to gather further identifiable information in order to confirm your identity, we will delete (and in turn direct our service providers to delete, if applicable) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. </p> <p> We may deny a deletion request if retaining the information is necessary to: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Complete the transaction for which we collected Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; </p> </li> <li> <p> Detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; </p> </li> <li> <p> Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; </p> </li> <li> <p> Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.); </p> </li> <li> <p> Exercise your free speech, ensure the right of another customer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law. </p> </li> <li> <p> Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations; </p> </li> <li> <p> Comply with legal obligations and requests from law enforcement agencies; and </p> </li> <li> <p> Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. </p> </li> </ul> <p> Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Information </p> <p> We do not sell data, as it is defined in the CCPA, will not sell Personal Information in the future, and in the preceding 12 months, have not sold any Personal Information. </p> <p> Request Submissions </p> <p> To exercise the access and deletion rights under the CCPA as described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request by emailing us at info@nestrecovery.me. </p> <p> Verifiable Consumer Requests </p> <p> A verifiable consumer request may be submitted by a California resident or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that is authorized to act on your behalf. These requests for access and deletion can only be made twice during a 12-month period. The request must: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Detail sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative; and </p> </li> <li> <p> Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. </p> </li> </ul> <p> We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. </p> <p> Timeframe for Responding to Requests and Format </p> <p> We will respond to your request within 30 days of receipt. The period of response may be extended to 60 or 90 days if more time is required. In that event, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. </p> <p> Fee </p> <p> We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. </p> <p> No Discrimination </p> <p> The CCPA prohibits a business from discriminating against California residents for exercising the rights outlined above. We will not discriminate against you for submitting such requests by: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Denying goods or services to you; </p> </li> <li> <p> Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts, benefits, or other penalties; </p> </li> <li> <p> Providing a different level or quality of goods or services; and </p> </li> <li> <p> Suggesting a different price or quality of goods or services will apply if rights are exercised. </p> </li> </ul> <p> No Financial Incentive </p> <p> We do not offer any financial incentives or price or service differences in an attempt to influence a resident's decision whether or not to exercise a right afforded to the consumer under the CCPA. </p> <p> Children's Information </p> <p> Our Website is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us by using the information in the \"Contact Us\" section below, and we will take steps to remove such Personal Information from our systems. </p> <p> Authorized Agent </p> <p> A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a right-to-access request or a request to delete. To use an authorized agent, the California resident must provide the agent with written authorization. In addition, the California resident may be required to verify their own identity with us. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the California resident to act on their behalf. Such requirements, however, will not apply where a California resident has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code Sections 4000 to 4465. </p> <p> Updates to this California Privacy Notice </p> <p> We are required by law to update this California Privacy Notice at least once each year (last updated on June 21, 2023). The effective date at the top of this page states when this California Privacy Notice was last revised. Any change to this California Privacy Notice will become effective when we post the revised California Privacy Notice on our Website.
